# codex-web

host codex desktop on a machine you control and reach it from a browser.

## motivation

the agents were never meant to stay trapped in a terminal window for long.
codex desktop brought the power of the agents to your local computer, where
your files, credentials, and tools already live.

codex-web brings codex desktop to the browser while keeping the backend on a
machine you control (a linux box in the cloud, your home lab, or a desktop / mac
mini). agents keep running after your laptop closes, and you can reconnect from
any device with a browser.

this project aims to be as thin a wrapper as possible to ensure upstream changes
to the codex desktop app can be integrated quickly.

## features

- can host on linux or macos
- reachable from the browser
- thin wrapper, so updates should stay fast and most desktop behavior already
  comes along for the ride
- working today:
  - subagents
  - inline images
  - editor sidepanel
  - transcription

## usage

`codex-web` serves the browser client and hosts the desktop-side bridge. by
default, it listens on `127.0.0.1:8214`.

it will use `codex` from `PATH` if available, or `CODEX_CLI_PATH` if you set
it.

run it with `npx`:

```bash
npx --yes github:0xcaff/codex-web
```

or with nix:

```bash
nix run github:0xcaff/codex-web
```

then open <http://127.0.0.1:8214> in a browser.

### sign in

ensure the codex cli on the host machine is signed in before starting the
server.

```bash
codex login --device-auth
```

### proxying to app-server (advanced usage)

it is often desirable to run app server separately and use `codex-web` as one
of many frontends to a long-lived app server decoupled from the lifespan of any
client (in case, for example, the client crashes)

it's possible to hook codex-web up to an already-running app server using the
`codex_remote_proxy` script.

start a long-lived app server somewhere:

```bash
codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:9001
# reachable now with `codex --remote  ws://127.0.0.1:9001` then `/resume`
```

then run `codex-web` with the proxy helper:

```bash
nix shell github:0xcaff/codex-web github:0xcaff/codex-web#codex_remote_proxy -c bash -lc '
  export CODEX_REMOTE_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:9001
  export CODEX_CLI_PATH="$(command -v codex_remote_proxy)"
  codex-web
'
```

## security

`codex-web` is not intended to be exposed directly to the public internet.
treat anyone who can reach the `codex-web` server as someone who can operate
codex on the host machine as that user.

someone with access to the web ui may be able to:

- run commands on the host, limited only by the permissions of the `codex-web`
  server process.
- read or modify files, environment variables, credentials, ssh keys, and other
  local resources that are accessible to that process.
- use the codex / chatgpt account already signed in on the host. this may
  consume usage quota or billing credits, and may expose account metadata shown
  by the app or cli, such as name or email address.

run `codex-web` only on a trusted network. do not expose it directly to the
internet. prefer access through wireguard, tailscale, or an ssh tunnel, and put
an authentication gateway or reverse proxy in front if other people or devices
can reach it.

## broken but want to fix

- terminal
- git worker is not hooked up yet
- browser panel, which might be possible to rebuild around iframes
- computer use on linux. this will be a very powerful feature
- probably more (file an issue please)
